# mvn-analysis
mvn-analysis provides image processing and analysis pipelines for .tif stack images of 3-dimensional microvascular networks (MVNs). 

Specifically, images of MVNs produced in the [Polacheck Lab](https://www.polachecklaboratory.com/ "Polacheck Group Page") are segmented in 2 and 3 dimensions to create water-tight triangle surface meshes and fully connected tetrahedral lumen meshes. These meshes can then be used as structural inputs for fluid dynamics models developed by the [Griffith Lab](http://griffith.web.unc.edu/ "Griffith Group Page") and [Dr. Simone Rossi](https://github.com/rossisimone/beatit "Rossi Github Repository") to estimate fluid forces within the MVN. Further, vascularly relevant statistics are applied to the 2D/3D segmentations and the segmentations are converted to NetworkX graphs with nodes at branches and endpoints and edges weighted by vessel length and width.
